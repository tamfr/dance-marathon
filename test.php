		<h2 class="story-heading">It was late summer 2009. <span class="text-muted">Amidst the heat, dreams took flight.</span></h2>
        <p class="lead">It started with a phone call.  Well it may have started a bit before, but that's when the message went out.  It's time to bring Dance Marathon to CWRU.  What inspired this action?  It's simple, the sign to the right and an a capella concert at the University of Michigan in the spring of 2008 entitled the UMDM Charity Concert.  But what's UMDM?</p>
      </div>

        <h2 class="story-heading">On the shoulders of giants. <span class="text-muted">We find our feet.</span></h2>
        <p class="lead">While the acronym UMDM has a nice ring to it, it stands for so much more: The University of Michigan Dance Marathon (now <a href="http://www.dmum.org" target="_blank">Dance Marathon at U of M</a>, but that's besides the point). The point is there was this great organization at U of M doing amazing things for kids through dance and Case didn't have it. So what's one to do...?  Research of course. So for the next year, countless hours were spent figuring out this concept of dancing for hours on end to raise money, which led to the discovery of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZS2znImpA78" target="_blank">this</a>, perhaps the single greatest inspirational tool used to launch Dance Marathon at CWRU.</p>

        <h2 class="story-heading">A table and chairs. <span class="text-muted">But no one use the chairs!</span></h2>
        <p class="lead">It was recruitment time.  Time to see if this thing was worth it.  Will Dance Marathon capture the hearts and minds of the world (well the campus that it is), or will it flop?  It was a hot sunny day at the 2009 Student Activities fair, the strategy was simple: no sitting, stand in front of the table, and don't let anyone walk by without telling them our story (as short as it was). For the next two hours, three of us wearing matching "DANCE MARATHON" t-shirts began making sparks.</p>

        <h2 class="story-heading">Simple gifts. <span class="text-muted">Our first meeting.</span></h2>
        <p class="lead">Running behind with not enough hands, I entered the Cleveland Room of Thwing to standing-room only.  Huddled around a large conference table, around twenty five people await anxiously to hear what this thing called Dance Marathon is.  But no meeting should end without action, so we stayed late making inspirational cards for the kids in the <a href="https://www.uhhospitals.org/rainbow" target="_blank">Rainbow Babies &amp; Children's Hospital</a>.  But the real gifts to come out of this meeting were the people, the <a href="#">awesome freshman</a> that made the group possible through thick and thin.</p>

        <p class="lead">Our core mission of engagement could not be achieved without impacting kids directly, working with them to brighten their day. So we quickly formed an alliance with UH working with Marge Galla to coordinate volunteering efforts in the hospital. We were almost overwhelmed with the demand to participate.  Featured here is the first orientation group on 12 September 2009.</p>

        <p class="lead">Never having thrown a fundraiser, we started small and perhaps cliche, we held a bake sale.  But have no misconceptions, bake sales are more work than they may seem.  The results? One person went to ER during food prep, one person baked for 7 hours, and over three days, we raised over $320 and delivered many smiles. FTK.</p>

        <p class="lead">In an effort to bring students and faculty together, we embarked on something truly unique, something special, something to our knowledge, no other dance marathon was doing: Dancing with the Stars.  But to avoid copyright issues, we called it Dancing with the CWRU Stars.  We recruited nine CWRU faculty and staff and paired them with professional dancers from around the area.  The stage was set, this was would be the event to see whether we have the guts; whether we could do something big, our stepping stone to the marathon.</p>
